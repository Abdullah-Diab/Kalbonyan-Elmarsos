### Course Notes.

- **Algorithms** are basically processes that describe how to perform certain tasks.

- No matter what kind of applications you build, you're bound to come across situations that require the use of one or more algorithms to get the job done.

- **Search algorithms:** Find specific data in a structure.

- **Sorting algorithms:** Apply a sort order to a dataset.

- **Computational algorithms:** Give a set of data, and calculate another.

- **Collection algorithms:** Work with collections of data as count, navigate among them, and filter them out.

- **Arrays** collection of elements, where each item is identified by an index or key.

- **Linked list** is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations, the elements in a linked list are linked using pointers, linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a link to the next node in the list.

- **Stack** is an ordered series of objects just like a list, but its intended use is slightly different. We push objectives onto the stack and pop objects off of it.

- **Queue** is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out [FIFO].

- **Hash Table** is an implementation of the associative array abstract data structure.

- **Recursion** is when a function calls itself within its own code.

  ```python
  def countdown
  if x == 0:
      print("Done")
      return
  else:
      print(x, "...")
      countdown(x-1)

  countdown(5)
  ```

- **Sorting Data Algorithms:**
  - **The bubble sort** works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
  - **The merge sort** divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.
  - T**he Quicksort** picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
