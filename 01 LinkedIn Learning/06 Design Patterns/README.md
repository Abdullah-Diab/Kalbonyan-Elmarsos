### Learning objectives:

- What are design patterns?
- Encapsulating code that varies with the Strategy pattern.
- The limitations of inheritance.
- Using the Adapter pattern.
- Implementing the Observer pattern.
- Extending behavior with composition and the Decorator pattern.
- Encapsulating iteration with the Iterator pattern.
- Object creation with the Factory Method pattern.
- Using design principles to guide your object-oriented design.

### Course Notes.

- **Design Pattern** is an approach to thinking about software design that incorporates the experience of developers who've had similar problems.

- **Benefits of Design Patterns:**

  - Don't reinvent the wheel.
  - Building resilient code.
  - Give us packaged-up design insight and experience.
  - Preparing for future additions.
  - Provide paths to solutions for some of the most common object-oriented design conundrums.
  - They're solutions developed over time through trial and error that are well-documented and can be applied to your specific design problem.

- **Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- **Adapter pattern** is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. The adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

- **Observer pattern** this pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when an object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- **Decorator pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide flexible alternatives to sub-classing for extending functionality.

- **Iterator pattern** provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

- **Factory pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
