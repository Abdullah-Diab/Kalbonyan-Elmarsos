### Course Notes.

- **Object-Oriented** is a programming paradigm. A set of ideas that's supported by many languages.

- **Object-Oriented Programing Languages** like C#, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Swift, and many others.

- **Objects are** attributes, properties, characteristics, states, fields, and variables.

- **Classes** are code-template for creating program objects.

- **Abstraction** is a natural extension of encapsulation. You have a lot of things in your cars but what happens to make it move doesn't concern you and any update to its mechanism rarely affects the abstraction you use.

- **Encapsulation** is bundling data and methods that work on that data within one class, To restrict access to some of the methods.

- **Inheritance** is reusing the common logic and extracting unique logic into a separate class.

- **Polymorphism** is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

- **Object-Oriented** to develop any software you need three things:

  - **Analysis:** Understand your problem. **What** do you need to do?
  - **Design:** Plan your solution. **How** you're going to do it.
  - **Programing:** Build it.

- **UML or Unified Modeling Language** is not a programming language. It's a graphical notation for drawing diagrams to visualize object-oriented systems.

- **Requirements** What does it need to do!

- **Functional Requirements** What must it do?

- **Non-Functional Requirements** How should it do it?

- **FURPS** is a checklist of several key qualities to consider when determining requirements:
  - **Functionality** refers to the capabilities and features of the app (Capability, Reusability, Security).
  - **Usability** affects the person who will be using the program (Human Factors, Aesthetics, Consistency, Documentation).
  - **Reliability** is how much system downtime is acceptable. If the failures are predictable and how the system can be recovered.
  - **Performance** dictates the application's response time throughput (Speed, Efficiency, Resource, Consumption, Scalability).
  - **Supportability** is to make sure the application can be tested, extended, serviced and installed, and configured.
