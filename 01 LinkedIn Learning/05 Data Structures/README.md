### Course Notes.

- **The data type** is the attribute of data that describes the values it can have and how the data can be used.

- **Data structures** are a way of accessing, organizing, and storing data.

- **The exact size of the data structure depends on**:

  - Allocated space for structure.
  - A number of pieces of data.
  - Size of each data piece.

- **Arrays** collection of elements, where each item is identified by an index or key.

- **A multidimensional array** is an array with more than two dimensions, the two dimensions are represented by rows and columns.

- **A jagged array** can have elements of different dimensions and sizes.

- **Search array** is a method for finding a target value within a list using for loop to check each index for our desired value.

- **Sort array** is a method to sort arrays before array searching in alphabetical, ascending, and descending order.

- **Big O notation** is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm, depending on operations like Access, Updated, Insert, Search, Delete, and Sort.

- **A linked list** is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations, the elements in a linked list are linked using pointers, linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the list.

- **Stack** is an ordered series of objects just like a list, but its intended use is slightly different. We push objectives onto the stack and pop objects off of it.

- **A queue** is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

- **Associative arrays** are special kinds of arrays, where indexing can be numeric or any other data type also called map or dictionaries.

- **Hashing** is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.

- **Hash Table** is an implementation of the associative array abstract data structure.

- **Sets** are collections of unique items as the order doesn't matter with no duplicated elements.

- **A Tree** in which elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right children.
